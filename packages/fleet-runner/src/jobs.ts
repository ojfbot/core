// Fleet-runner queue. Lifted from BookcaseDiscovery src/run/jobs.ts under AGPL-3.0-only.
// Jobs are cache-keyed and claimed under a lease and fencing token. Callers use JobStore methods.
//
// `jobs` holds current state; `job_events` is append-only (UPDATE and DELETE refused by trigger) and
// is what the morning report reads. Neither ever holds reader text or image content: payloads may
// name private paths, so the CLI never prints them, and outputs are recorded by content hash.
//
// The fencing token guards the artifact as well as the row: each attempt writes its own immutable file
// (`<key>.<fence>.<ext>`), and only the guarded completion records which file is accepted. A stale worker
// can still write bytes, but never into the file a consumer reads.
